TECHNOLOGY STACK
Python: The primary programming language used to build the chatbot application.
Web Framework:
Flask: A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python used to create the web application and handle HTTP requests. Flask serves as the backbone for the chatbot's web interface.
Frontend Technologies:
HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web pages.
CSS: Used for styling the web pages and making them visually appealing.
JavaScript: Used for handling client-side interactions and sending asynchronous requests to the server for chatbot responses.
Jinja2: The templating engine that comes with Flask, used to dynamically render HTML pages and inject chatbot responses into the frontend.
Data Handling:
Python Data Structures: The chatbot uses Python dictionaries and lists to store predefined responses, stress relief exercises, and motivational quotes.
Random Module:A Python standard library module used to randomly select a motivational quote from a predefined list.
Web Server:
Flask's Built-in Development Server: During development, Flask's built-in server is used to run the application. For production, a more robust web server like Gunicorn could be used in conjunction with a web server like Nginx.
Local Environment: The chatbot can be run locally using Flask's development server.
